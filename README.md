# LegacySnapshot
Manipulation of data extracted from SAPgui transaction "IA17".
This is a stand-alone collection from [a larger set of codes](https://github.com/SoloSynth1/vba-excel-macros) to carry out tasks related to SAPgui's "IA17" transcation.

There are two main functionalities of this code collection:
1. To regularly dump data snapshots into local storage. This is done by scheduling the code to be ran in every midnight.
2. To make query and create result pages. This relys on the snapshot funcationality #1 created.

For detailed explanation and usage of the codes, please refer to the [Standard Operation Procedures](./SOP%20for%20Generation%20of%20SAP%20Data%20Snapshots.docx).
